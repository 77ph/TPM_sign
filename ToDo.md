## ✅ Completed Features

| Step | Component                                      | Status   | Notes |
|------|------------------------------------------------|----------|-------|
| 1    | Persistent Primary Key Creation                | ✅ Done  | Auto-generated if not present |
| 2    | TPM Key Generation (`.priv` / `.pub`)          | ✅ Done  | `create` command implemented |
| 3    | TPM-backed Message Signing                     | ✅ Done  | `sign` command with message input |
| 4    | Ethereum EIP-2 `low-s` Signature Enforcement   | ✅ Done  | Signature rejected if `s > N/2` |
| 5    | Export Ethereum-style Signature (`r,s,v`)      | ✅ Done  | JSON output via `--eth` flag |
| 6    | Signature Verification                         | ✅ Done  | `verify` command |
| 7    | List Available Keys                            | ✅ Done  | `list` command |
| 8    | Signature Logging (`logs/signatures.log`)      | ✅ Done  | JSONL format logging with metadata |
| 9    | Protection Against `key.priv` Substitution     | ✅ Done  | Public key hash validated via `.meta.json` |
| 10   | Key Pool Manager (max 1 loaded key at a time)  | ✅ Done  | Automatic flush & context tracking |

## 🔜 Planned / Not Yet Implemented

| Component                          | Status | Plan |
|-----------------------------------|--------|------|
| PCR-Based Sealing                 | ❌ Not yet | Will restrict key usage to specific boot states |
| REST API (Flask or FastAPI)       | ❌ Not yet | To be added after CLI features are finalized |
| LRU-Based Key Pool (multi-slot)   | ❌ Not yet | For concurrent key usage with cache management |
| Configurable Settings (YAML)      | ❌ Not yet | External configuration for paths and limits |
| Automated Testing (unit/smoke)    | ❌ Not yet | To validate CLI behavior and key integrity |

## 🧭 Current Status

The CLI tool is stable and supports:
- Secure key generation and signing via TPM 2.0
- Ethereum-compatible output with `r,s,v`
- Key lifecycle tracking and public key verification
- One-key-at-a-time key pool management

REST API and PCR-based sealing will follow once CLI logic is fully hardened.
